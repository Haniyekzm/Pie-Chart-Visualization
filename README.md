# Amino Acid Energy Distribution (Pie Chart Visualization)

This repository contains a Python script that visualizes the **distribution of amino acids based on their energy values** using pie charts.  
The script separates amino acids into two groups:  
1. **Non-negative energy (0 and positive values)**  
2. **Negative energy**  

Two pie charts are generated to show the percentage of amino acids in each category.

##  Motivation
In computational chemistry and molecular simulations, visualizing the energy distribution of amino acids can provide quick insights into:  
- The stability of specific residues  
- The fraction of residues contributing negative vs. non-negative energies  
- Patterns useful for further structural or binding analysis

##  Features
- Reads amino acid energy values from an input file  
- Splits amino acids into two categories: negative vs. non-negative energy  
- Generates two pie charts:  
  - Pie chart for negative-energy amino acids  
  - Pie chart for non-negative-energy amino acids  
- Easy to customize and extend
